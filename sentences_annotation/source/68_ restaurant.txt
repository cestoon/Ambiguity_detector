The restaurant registration process will start with a registration request, and it will end with the restaurant being registered. When a registration request has been performed by the restaurant, the restaurant has to upload 3 documents (menu, restaurant info, and bank info). After uploading documents Just Eat must verify all the documents. If documents are not uploaded, then they cannot be verified and the restaurant will not be registered. When the documents have been successfully verified, the restaurant will be registered and the process is done.

In the ordering-food process, initially, food will be ordered by the customer and eventually will be delivered to complete the order process. After ordering food the customer must pay for the food. If the payment fails the customer must place a new order. The order cannot be completed if payment fails. After successful payment the restaurant must process the order. The restaurant must then prepare the food. If the restaurant does not prepare the food the customer will be refunded and should place a new order. When the food has been prepared, the delivery driver should pick up and deliver the food. If the delivery driver does not deliver the food, the customer will be refunded and should place a new order. When the food has been successfully delivered the process ends.
