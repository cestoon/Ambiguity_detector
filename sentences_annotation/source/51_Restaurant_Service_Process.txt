The process starts with the client arriving at the restaurant. Once the client has arrived, the waitstaff must sit the customer and give him the menu. The waiter can’t place the food order before the customer knows what to eat. If the food is ready the waitstaff can serve the food. When the meal is served, the waiter must stand by the customer to finish his dish. After finishing it, the customer can order more food or can ask for the bill. Once the bill has been requested, the waiter must bring it. The customer can’t leave the restaurant without paying either with cash or card. After the payment process the waiter must give the client his receipt. Finally, the client can leave and the waiter is free to take another incoming customer, as well as the client is capable to re-enter the restaurant.
