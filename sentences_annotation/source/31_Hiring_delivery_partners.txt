The process starts when an applicant visits the recruitment website and fills out a pre-screening test. The results of this test are automatically parsed by the automation system and are imported into a spreadsheet that is used as a database for the delivery partners.

All applicants with a test score above 89 pass the test. If the applicant does not pass the test, an email is sent to the applicant to notify them of the rejection. The operations department manually assesses all failed applicants. If there is high delivery partner demand, the operations department assess the demand of hiring applicants with a certain profile. If not deemed necessary, the applicant is stored for future reference.
All applicants that pass the test are marked as “passed” and are sent a congratulatory email with an invitation to the introduction event. The applicant has to sign up for a given date to be able to attend the introduction. If the applicant does not sign up for an introduction within seven days - a reminder will be sent via email.

The applicant will either show up or not show up to the introduction, but the applicant cannot proceed in the onboarding process until he/she has attended the introduction event. The event host keeps track of which applicants attend each event. When the applicant has been registered as having attended the introduction, they will receive an invitation to fill in the “final information” form, where all necessary legal information is entered.

After the final information form is completed and sent back to the operations department, a contract is generated by the operations department, and the applicant is requested to sign the contract on the digital platform. Once the applicant signs the contract, they are officially a delivery partner. A customer service employee will deliver the gear and activate the delivery partner before their first shift.
