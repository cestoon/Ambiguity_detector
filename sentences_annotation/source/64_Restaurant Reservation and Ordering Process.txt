When a customer wishes to dine at the restaurant, they must reserve a table via the restaurant’s website, selecting a free table for a specified time. If the reservation is successful, the restaurant’s web server must generate a secure link, which must be emailed to the customer, otherwise the web server must send a notification to customer saying the reservation is failed. The secure link can only be activated when the customer arrives at the restaurant no later than fifteen minutes past the reserved time and connects to the restaurant’s Wi-Fi.
Once the secure link is accessed, the ordering system must lead the customer to the restaurant’s menu, where they can view and select items to order. The customer must complete payment for the order using MobilePay, GooglePay, or a similar service before the order is sent to the kitchen.
After payment is confirmed, the ordering system must send the order to kitchen and notify the customer that their meal is being prepared. Afterwards the ordering system must send another notification when the meal is ready for service. Concurrently, the ordering system must send a notification to the waiters on their pager indicating that the meal is ready, and the waiters must pick up the meal from the kitchen and serve it to the customer’s table. While dining, the customer may place additional orders by accessing the menu through the previously provided secure link, following the same procedure of ordering and pre-payment.
