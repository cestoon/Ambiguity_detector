Registration deadline timer: All students must complete the course registration before the registration deadline. The system will continue to accept registration until the set deadline, which is controlled by the timer. Once the deadline is reached, any incomplete registration will be automatically terminated. The rules of the system ensure that all registration activities are completed within this time limit.

Course capacity monitoring: Each course has the maximum number of registrants. Once the registration number of any course reaches this limit, the system will no longer accept new registration requests until the quota is obtained due to the studentâ€™s cancellation of registration. In addition, the system may provide a waiting list option for students who exceed the limit, allowing them to receive vacancy notices. The rules ensure that the course is not overcrowded.

Course conflict detection: The system stipulates that the courses registered by students shall not have time conflicts. Throughout the registration process, the course chosen by each student must meet this condition. The system automatically checks conflicts during registration and only allows successful registration requests that meet the schedule. This rule ensures that students can take all registered courses without scheduling problems.
