The steps performed in the process are as follows: A school sends a request for a visit at the university, the manager then receives the request and checks for a suitable date. The manager sends a confirmation mail regarding the school visit and date to the requesting school. Next the manager will contact both the facility management and the student ambassadors. The facility management checks for an available room and book the room if there is any available. If not they inform the manager so that the manager can cancel the visit. The student ambassadors are notified about the visit and the date through a poll posted by the manager on a collaboration software. The student ambassadors have three days to answer the poll before it is reviewed. If three or more ambassadors have signed up, three ambassadors are selected by the manager and are then signed up for the school visit. If less than three student ambassadors have signed up, the poll deadline will be extended by two days followed by a new review of the poll by the manager. If there are still less than three student ambassadors available for the visit the manager cancels the visit by sending an email to the school. If more student ambassadors have signed up after the poll extension, three student ambassadors are selected by the manager and are signed up for the school visit. If both a room and three student ambassadors have been booked/signed up the manager creates an agenda of the day and send it to the school as a final confirmation of the visit.
