Restaurant Management System: The system description, as from the previous assignment: Enables restaurants to manage profiles, menus, and availability status on the Wolt platform. It facilitates order processing, notification management, and performance tracking.
Menu Update Latency: Changes to the menu (additions, deletions, or modifications) should be reflected on the platform shortly after submission to ensure current availability is accurately represented.
Order Acknowledgment Time: Restaurants must acknowledge new orders to confirm they have begun preparation and to keep the customer informed of the order status.
Availability Status Update: Changes to restaurant availability status (open or closed) must be processed and displayed on the platform to prevent customer confusion or order placement errors.
Courier Management System: The system description, as from the previous assignment: Onboards, schedules, and dispatches delivery orders to local couriers. It tracks courier locations, optimizes delivery routes, and provides communication tools for couriers.
Courier Dispatch Time: Couriers should be dispatched to pick up an order shortly before preparation completion to minimize waiting time and ensure timely delivery.

Location Update Interval: Courier location updates should be transmitted to the platform for accurate tracking and route optimization.
Route Optimization Processing: Route optimization calculations should be use the couriers current location, updating to ensure efficient delivery paths are identified immediately.
Order Processing System: The system description, as from the previous assignment: Coordinates the entire order lifecycle, from placement to delivery. It handles order routing, confirmation, transaction and tracking, ensuring timely and accurate delivery of food items. 

The timed behavior can be divided into three categories:
Order Placement to Confirmation: The time from order placement by the customer to confirmation by the restaurant should be within 5 minutes to ensure customers are quickly informed of their order status.
Delivery Time Estimation Accuracy: The estimated delivery time provided to the customer at the time of order placement should be close to the actual delivery time.
Order Tracking Update Frequency: Customers should receive updates on their order status (e.g., preparing, ready for pickup, en route) to keep them informed throughout the delivery process.
