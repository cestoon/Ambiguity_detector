Every time a person enters Netto, they can use the Scan and Go app to put in their basket whatever they need to buy. If an item is scanned, then it needs to be put in the basket. After the scanning process, every user must mark their shopping basket ready for validation and every time a basket is marked that way, it is not possible anymore to abort the process until the validation is done. Not every basket may need to be validated, but every basket has to be marked as ready before proceeding to the validation process. If no validation is needed, the user can proceed to pay for their items and mark the purchase as done. If validation is needed, the basket will be checked by the cashier and the outcome may be successful or failed. After a successful validation, the user can proceed directly to finalize the purchase as before. In case of a failed validation, the user needs to fix their basket by re-scanning and re-validating the missing items. After fixing their basket, they can proceed to finalize the purchase as before. The payment operation can only happen once.
