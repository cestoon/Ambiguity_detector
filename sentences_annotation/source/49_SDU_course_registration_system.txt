The main goal of the course registration system is to have students registering to their courses. Before the registration period starts, course responsibles must update information and publish course.
The system must have the students unregistered to courses when the course is published. The student can register to a course when registration starts. The system must confirm student registration through an email when students register. The system must register new students to a course when the registration period starts. The new students can verify their automatic registration via the link provided in an email.
A student can unregister a registered course within the registration period.
The administration must lock the course for registration once the registration period ends.
