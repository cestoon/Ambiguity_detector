The process of ordering at McDonaldâ€™s can incorporate timed behavior in several places. The most obvious instance of timed behavior is when the kitchen prepares the food. An example of this is fries that need to be freshly prepared every so often as to not go soft. So while fries can be pre-prepared they must either be used in orders or re-made before going bad. Another instance of timed behavior is found during the ordering and payment phase. If a customer starts making an order but never finishes, the ordering machine should reset after some time. This is to allow other customers to start an ordering process without having to remove everything that has already been selected. The payment process can also potentially timeout due to network errors or similar issues. As such it should be possible to force customers to go to the cashier to pay if the payment times out at the machine.
