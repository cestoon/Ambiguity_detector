The process begins when the Project Manager must hand over the Operational Readiness Review (ORR) documentation task to the Delivery Project Lead (DPL). The DPL must initialise the ORR process once, thereafter the contract requirements and the ORR checklist must be checked.Then the DPL must create the documentation tasks for the different stakeholders. He sends these tasks to the Operations Team who creates the documentation required. The DPL also sends documentation tasks to the Project Manager, who then delegates the tasks in the project team. The Operations Team and the Project Manager sends the documentation to the DPL once the tasks are completed. The DPL receives the documentation from the Project Manager and the Operation Team Manager and compiles the documentation. Then the DPL sends an invitation to the Project Manager and the Operations Team Manager for an approval meeting. At the meeting they either reject or approve the documentation. If it gets rejected, the documentation has to be reworked. If there is rework, the approval will be in written format without a new meeting. After the approval, the DPL compiles the documentation and sends it to approval with the customer. If the documentation is approved at the meeting, the DPL must send the documentation to approval with the customer. The customer receives and reads the documentation, and either rejects or approves it. If rejected, the customer must send the documentation back to the DPL, who then facilitates the rework. If approved, the document is sent to the DPL and the ORR process is complete.
