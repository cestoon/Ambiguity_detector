We transformed our process flow into a set of declarative business rules, they go as follows.
Stakeholder Dependencies:
Rule 1: IF a Customer is present, THEN a Waiter MUST be available to provide service.
Rule 2: IF an order is placed, THEN a Chef MUST be available to prepare the food.
Rule 3: IF a Customer has completed their meal, THEN a Cashier MUST be available to process payment.
Rule 4: IF any stakeholder group (Customer, Waiter, Chef, Cashier) is understaffed, THEN the Manager MUST take action to address the shortage.
Service and Food Quality:
Rule 5: IF an order is placed, THEN the Chef MUST prepare the food within a specified maximum time limit.
Rule 6: IF a menu item is ordered, THEN the kitchen MUST have all necessary ingredients in stock.
Rule 7: IF a menu item has a preparation time exceeding a defined threshold,
THEN the Customer MUST be informed before ordering.
Customer Experience:
Rule 8: IF a Customer requests information or assistance, THEN a Waiter MUST provide a timely response.
Rule 9: IF a Customer provides feedback, THEN the Manager MUST review and consider the feedback for potential process improvements.
Workflow:
Rule 10: IF a Waiter communicates an order to the kitchen, THEN the Chef MUST add the order to the preparation queue.
Rule 11: IF a Chef completes a food order, THEN the Waiter MUST be notified.
Rule 12: IF a Customerâ€™s meal is complete, THEN the Waiter MUST provide the bill to the Cashier.
Rule 13: IF a bill is presented to the Cashier, THEN the Cashier MUST process the payment and provide a receipt to the Customer.
