Customers are required to select items from the menu, initiating their order based on their preferences from a wide range of food and beverage options. The order system accommodates orders placed through three main channels—inside the restaurant, via the drive-thru, or through the mobile app, which offers flexibility and convenience to meet the customers’ needs and circumstances. Once the order is made, completion of payment is mandatory before the order is processed. This necessitates customers to successfully complete transactions using available payment methods such as cash, MobilePay, or credit card. For customers choosing table services or curbside pickup, specifying a precise location is essential. Moreover, orders must be assembled accurately according to customer requests, including any customizations or special instructions provided at the time of ordering.


Within the kitchen, ingredients for the menu should be prepared early in the day, with kitchen staff tasked with slicing vegetables, seasoning meats, and organizing packaging materials. Besides, the cooking equipment, including grills, fryers, and assembly stations, is checked and preheated for readiness to use. The main food items, such as burgers, sandwiches, wraps, and fries, are cooked according to standardized recipes and specific cooking times to ensure consistency. Side items are cooked in batches and kept in warming trays to maintain freshness, while salads and other cold items are assembled upon request to ensure they remain crisp and fresh. Once the cooking phase is complete, orders are assembled with accuracy and undergo a quality check to guarantee customer satisfaction. A critical rule here is the double-checking of orders before they are sent out for delivery or pickup. Each completed order must be verified by checking the name or number associated with the order when delivering to customers using the method they chose—be it at the counter, through the drive-thru, or for table service. Last but not least, throughout the day, the kitchen maintains high hygiene standards with continuous cleaning and prompt equipment maintenance.


In our system, kitchen staff are alerted to begin preparations only if an order has been successfully confirmed, ensuring a streamlined process that avoids extra preparation for invalid orders. Once an order is validly placed, the system prompts the kitchen to move from a waiting state to actively preparing the order. This effectively links order processing to kitchen operations. Parallel to the food preparation period, the automated inventory system monitors stock in order to guarantee that levels are adequately maintained and initiates restocking actions as long as stocks approach low levels. This framework not only ensures a seamless operation from the point of customer order to meal readiness but also actively prevents stock shortages and operational deadlock.
