The customer makes an order on Wolt’s website or mobile application, specifying restaurant, the food and if they want to pick up the order or if they want it delivered. When Wolt receives the order, it is then registered.The order is then distributed to the restaurant where it can be either accepted or rejected due to being busy or lack of required ingredients to execute the order. If the order is accepted, the restaurant begins preparing the food. Additionally, if delivery option is chosen and the order is accepted, Wolt’s system immediately starts allocating a vacant courier that can pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. It is determined by range from the customer and the restaurant - couriers usually operate in a designated area - if they are in range and vacant they are prompted if they want to accept the order. If not, the allocating process restarts. If the courier accepts, they head towards the restaurant to pick up the order. When it is picked up, the courier travels towards the customer to deliver the order.
