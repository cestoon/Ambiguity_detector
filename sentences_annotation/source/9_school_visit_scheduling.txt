A school sends a request regarding school visit to the manager. The manager receives the request and checks the calendar. If date is available the manager assigns a date. The manager sends an email with school visit confirmed. 

The manager has to find student ambassadors and therefore sends out a poll to the student ambassadors informing them of the date. This gives the student ambassadors the chance to sign up if they are available. After 3 days the poll is reviewed by the manage. If more than 3 have applied the manager assign three ambassadors for the visit. If less than 3 have replied the manager will notify the ambassadors again about the school visit and extend the sign up period by two days. After the extension of two days, the poll is reviewed again and if three or more student ambassadors have answered she will assign three ambassadors.

While the sign up period is running, the manager has to find a room. The manager contacts Facility management to check for available rooms. If there is an available room the room is booked.

If the manager finds a room and available student ambassadors, the manager creates an agenda and sends the agenda as a confirmation to the school. 

Reasons for cancellation: 
If the date is not available the manager cancel the request. 
If less than three student ambassadors are available after the two sign up periods, the school visit must be cancelled.
If there are no rooms available for the school visit, the manager is notified by the facility management and the school visit must be cancelled.
