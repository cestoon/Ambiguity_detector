When customers place an order via the large screen in the lobby, they can keep selecting food items until they decide to finish their order, which will then be sent to the kitchen. If the customer is still ordering, and has not chosen something within 30 seconds, the lobby screen will prompt a message, ”Would you still like to order?”. If they select yes, the customer can continue to order. However, if the prompt is ignored for a minute, the entire process is restarted to the welcome page on the screen.

When a customer is done, they will select a payment method for which they can choose to pay at the lobby screen or at the counter. When selecting ”pay at the register” payment option, the order will be dispatched to all stations within the restaurant triggering a timer. If the customer does not pay or does not show up the order will be automatically canceled and removed from all stations.

Orders are displayed in the kitchen once they have been paid for (by the customer at the lobby screen or counter). The order is flagged green, yellow, or red depending on how long it has been in preparation: green if the timer is between 0 - 60 seconds, which turns yellow if the timer is 60 - 100 seconds, and finally red if beyond 100 seconds. The seconds are utilized to calculate the average completion time for orders in the kitchen, which is a crucial metric for determining the optimal placement of workers.
