Before a customer can place an order a delivery driver must come online. To start the process a customer must select a restaurant and choose food. When this is done the customer must provide delivery address. Given the delivery address Wolt must calculate total cost and estimate delivery time. From this point on a delivery driver cannot go offline until the order has been completed. The customer must then provide payment information which Wolt must verify. If the customer has enough money then Wolt must inform the restaurant of the order and reserve the money on the customers bank account. If the customer does not have enough money the process ends this also happens if it takes more than 5 minutes to verify the payment. When the restaurant receives an order they must prepare the food.
Meanwhile Wolt must ask a delivery driver if they want to deliver the given order. The delivery driver may accept to deliver or decline to deliver. The delivery driver has 2 minutes otherwise the request times out and another delivery driver is asked. If the driver declines then Wolt must try another delivery driver. Once a delivery driver has accepted the order they must go to the restaurant. When the restaurant has finished the food the delivery driver can pick up the food at the restaurant and deliver it to the customer. If the food is not delivered within 120 minutes then the customer does not pay. When customer gets their food Wolt must receive payment and send a receipt to the customer.
