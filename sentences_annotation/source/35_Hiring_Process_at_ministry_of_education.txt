The process takes place at the HR department within the Ministry of Higher Education and Science. Here we seek to identify the process of hiring a new candidate. The process that has been chosen is a support process within process architecture. The HR department (support process) will support the permanent secretary (core process) in hiring candidates. These can- didates are valuable as their work helps the permanent secretary to succeed in different tasks. The process of hiring a new candidate consists of three different phases. In this report, we have chosen to focus on one of the phases. This has been chosen to get a more comprehensive and deep understanding of the process. The process chosen is starting from when a deadline for a position is reached until the first interview.
When the deadline for a certain job is reached, the HR department will screen the applications for people, evoking their equal rights as disabled, as well as screening for internal applicants. While the screening is happening, the head of the department reads the applications. When the applications have been screened and looked through, the HR employee and head of department meets to select the candidates invited for the first interview. The HR department then calls the chosen candidates until they pick up their phone. When invited, the candidate can either decline or accept the invitation. If the invitation is accepted, they will agree on a timeslot for the inter- view over the phone. The HR employee will prepare an email with information regarding the first interview. The head of department and candidate will then read the email. After this, the chosen employee, head of department and candidate will be present at the interview.
