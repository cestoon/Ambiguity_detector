Every order is initially created and eventually completed. To create an order the respective payment needs to be completed successfully first. The payment selection can be done either via credit card, mobile pay or cash. To pay in cash it must be done via the cashier. The customisation of a possible order can be done multiple times but only before the validation process; once validated the payment type can be chosen. To do so the customer interacts with the kiosk where the selection of the language (optional) and of the items to add to the current possible order are made. The selection for the order type (eat-in or take-away) is made only before the payment selection and after the confirmation/validation of the current possible order. The payment can be done directly at the kiosk either via card, where the POS has to be activated and processes the transaction after having successfully read the credit card or via mobile pay. If paid by cash the cashier has to handle the payment. Upon successful payment the receipt is printed, either at the kiosk or by the cashier and the order is created in the system. After creating an order, it cannot be modified, but its status can be tracked via the KDS screens. A created order can change its status and is displayed on the KDS System. Its first status is “Order Received”. Once the order is being prepared its status changes into “Order In Progress” and finally “Order Ready”. The KDS System is interacted by the Cook, who starts preparing the order not before the “Order Received” status is sent to him and on preparation the cook changes it to “Order in preparation”. The customer can collect the order after the order has been assembled by the Order Assembler, who also updates the status to “Order Ready” status which is displayed on the screen.
