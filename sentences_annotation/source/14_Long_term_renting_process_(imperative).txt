The process begins when an employee contacts a long-term seller from the waiting list. The long-term seller in our BPMN pays to rent a shelf for 14 weeks. Once the seller has paid and two weeks has passed, the seller will move in. We have then included a subprocess describing the different activities a seller can do to maintain their shelf. The first subprocess indicates that an active seller will regularly renew their shelf to ensure they are profitable, whilst a passive seller will not.

After 12 weeks of the seller's renting period has passed, an employee will contact the seller to ask if the seller would like to extend their shelf. This activity is also connected to a subprocess which goes into detail and describes the alternative options for responding to the employee. If a seller decides they do not want to extend their renting period, they will inform an employee at the store and move out at the end of their 14-week renting period. Management will terminate the contract and an employee will contact the next seller from the waiting list.

If the seller would like to extend their renting period, management must review the seller's request. Management will check if the seller's weekly revenue is greater than or equal to 700 DKK. If the revenue meets the requirement, management will approve the request and an employee will take payment from the seller for the next renting period. The seller can then continue to rent their shelf. If the seller's revenue is less than 700 DKK, management will try to advise the seller against the request. The seller can either accept the suggestion and move out or decline the suggestion. If the seller declines the suggestion from management, the seller will be granted an extension regardless of management's suggestions. The employee will then take payment from the seller for the extension period.
