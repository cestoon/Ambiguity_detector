The updated system description with timed behavior has been modelled as timed automata in UPPAAL. For each stakeholder: Ordering Machine, Cashier, Kitchen and Customer, we have constructed an automata. Figure 1a shows the timed automata for the cashier. The cashier has no timings since the cashier is not dependent on other tasks. The cashier can either take an order and receive payment for it or receive payment for an order that has been done on the machine. The cashier also delivers the food once it is finished. Figure 1b show the timed automata for the customer. A customer must first choose between ordering at the machine or cashier. The customer can choose to pay at the cashier even when ordering at the machine. If the payment at the machine times out, the customer will be forced to pay at the cashier. Once payment is done the customer will get a receipt and wait for the food to be delivered. Figure 1c shows the timed automata for the ordering machine. It lets the customer choose items from a menu, and when the customer is finished it asks for payment either there or at the cashier. Once payment is done a receipt is printed and the kitchen is notified. If no user input is given for a while, the machine will timeout and go back to idle to allow other customers to use it. Figure 1d shows the timed automata for the kitchen. The kitchen simply waits to be notified about orders and then prepares the food. However the kitchen must make new fries if the time limit on the current fries is exceeded, in order to avoid soft fries.
