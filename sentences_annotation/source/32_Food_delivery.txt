The process begins with the guest placing their order on Sticks’n’Sushi’s homepage, where they also enter the required personal information, and from which restaurant they wish to order. Once the guest has placed the order and paid, using Sticks’n’Sushi’s online ordering system, the system automatically sends a notification to both Sticks’n’Sushi and Takeout, with a predetermined delivery time. The order enters the system with 20 minutes dislocated to the selected delivery time chosen by the guest. Hereafter will a​ Front of House e​ mployee confirm the order by selecting a final pickup time, this pick up time is part of a prearranged agreement between Sticks’n’Sushi and Takeout, which always places it 15 minutes after the time on the order as it enters the system. For instance, if the guest places a order for delivery for 14:05, will the order enter the system for 13:45, hereafter will the prearranged agreement between the parties mean that the Sticks’n’Sushi employee will confirm the order to be ready at 14:00 for pick up by the Takeout delivery driver.

The ​Back of House,​ kitchen staff​,​ will receive a ticket with the order details and what time the order should be ready. Simultaneously a receipt is printed for the employee packing the order later on in the process. During this time, the guest can see an online countdown, for when their order is expected to arrive. When the Back of House prepares the order they stay aware of whether the order contains hot food, cold food or both. It will be automatically distributed amongst two different Back of House sections preparing either hot or cold food. Once the order has been prepared, it is packed and checked by a ​Front of House​, waiter or waitress.

Then, the packed order is passed on to the ​Takeout delivery driver,​ who transports the order to the guest. Finally, the order arrives at the guest’s location.
