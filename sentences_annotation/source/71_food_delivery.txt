A customer is initially waiting in the queue and eventually either walks away or places an order. Once a customer places an order the cashier must receive this order and request payment. An order can not be received before it has been placed and a payment can not be requested for an order before the order has been received. An order can only be received once. Only once the customer has received a request for payment, the customer must scan the QR and use their payment client to send money within a given time limit. If the customer fails to send money within this time limit, they may try again. Once the payment server receives the money, it must send a receipt to the customer. Only once the customer shows the receipt to the cashier, the cashier forwards the order to the chef. After having received an order, the chef must prepare the food in the order. The chef may only serve food that is properly cooked. The chef must discard food that is not cooked properly and restart cooking the food. Once food has been cooked properly the customer must pick up the food.
